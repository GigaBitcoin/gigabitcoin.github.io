What's Darkcoin?
================

via [Darkcoin Whitepaper](http://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/DarkcoinWhitepaper.pdf)

> Darkcoin is the first privacy centric cryptographic currency based on Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin. DarkSend, a technology for sending anonymous block transactions is incorporated directly into the client using extensions to the core protocol. An improved proof­of­work using a chain of hashing algorithms replaces the SHA256 algorithm and will result in a slower encroachment of more advanced mining technologies (such as ASIC devices). DarkGravityWave is implemented to provide quick response to large mining power fluctuations.

What's a Masternode?
====================

via [wiki.darkcoin.eu](http://wiki.darkcoin.eu/wiki/FAQ#What_are_Master_Nodes.3F)

> Masternodes are network nodes, owned by the users of Darkcoin network. They perform the coin mixing service of DarkSend which anonymizes transactions. Users get rewarded with 20% of the mining output per block (without actually performing any mining themselves) through a "voting mechanism".
